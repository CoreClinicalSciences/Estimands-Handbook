# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is the website for **"A Living Handbook on Estimands"**. This book is intended to be a living resource designed to help the readers understand and apply the concept of estimands in clinical trials, evidence synthesis, and other quantitative research studies. 

We hope to assist the researchers and consumers of health research who want to learn more about estimands. Some chapters will be intended for those with minimal background to statistics and health research. We will provide more technical discussion in other chapters, as needed. 

From a selfish point of view, we decided to write this book to improve our understanding of the estimands framework as outlined in the [ICH E9(R1) addendum](https://database.ich.org/sites/default/files/E9-R1_Step4_Guideline_2019_1203.pdf). As more work is disseminated in this area, we aim to update the book over time to stay up-to-date in our understanding of their relevance and implications to health research. 

## Structure and Navigation of This Handbook

Each chapter will be written to be as self-contained as possible. Each chapter will contain introductory summaries with the chapter's intended learning objectives with 3-5 key summaries. 

## Contribution and Feedback

Feedback (hopefully constructive) and contributions are welcome.
