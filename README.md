# Estimands Handbook

This is a living online resource exploring the **estimands framework** as outlined in the [ICH E9(R1) Addendum on Estimands and Sensitivity Analysis in Clinical Trials](https://database.ich.org/sites/default/files/E9-R1_Step4_Guideline_2019_1203.pdf). 

Our intention is that this resource can be used to demystify the concept of estimands, improve its adoption and application in real case studies, and (selfishly) further enhance our understanding of estimands.
